                <header class="header"> About Me</header>
                <p class="lead">I didn’t begin my professional journey in engineering, I started behind a bar.
                    Bartending taught me more than how to mix
                    a good drink, it gave me my first lessons in communication, teamwork, and relationship building.
                    When you connect with
                    the people around you, work becomes more fulfilling, collaboration flows naturally, and challenges
                    become easier to
                    overcome.</p>
                <p class="lead">When I transitioned into engineering, these interpersonal skills became my biggest
                    advantage. My first large milestone
                    was at Atlantic & Peninsula, where I worked as a mechanical engineering intern responsible for
                    maintaining naval ships.
                    Here I developed time management, stakeholder communication, and a disciplined approach to
                    mechanical systems. I began
                    to understand that engineering was not just about solving technical problems, it was also about
                    managing complexity,
                    people, and processes in high-stakes environments.</p>
                <p class="lead">From there, I broadened my experience through multiple internships, from wind tunnel
                    testing at Windtech to naval
                    systems at Sofraco, each requiring me to adapt, learn, and grow in different directions. These roles
                    gave me a strong
                    foundation in mechanical systems and organisational practices, but my most transformative experience
                    came at Advanced
                    Navigation.</p>
                <p class="lead">At Advanced Navigation, I stepped into a role that blended mechanical, electrical, and
                    embedded systems engineering. I
                    designed custom jigs, developed production processes, repaired PCBs, and contributed to new product
                    introductions. I
                    found myself not only building hardware but also building processes, from technician training to
                    production
                    documentation, ensuring that products could move reliably from concept to manufacture.</p>
                <p class="lead">What surprised me most was how much self-learning professional engineering demands.
                    Every project brought something
                    unfamiliar, new tools, standards, or systems I had to quickly pick up. Over time, I built a mindset
                    of problem-solving,
                    adaptability, and continuous learning that now defines how I approach challenges.</p>
                <p class="lead">Today, I see myself as a dependable and adaptable engineer with hands-on experience
                    across mechanical, naval, and
                    embedded systems engineering. I thrive on solving problems, learning new skills, and building strong
                    relationships with
                    the people I work with. My passions lie in creating technology that brings together hardware,
                    electronics, and software
                    in a way that is collaborative, reliable, and innovative.</p>
