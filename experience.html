                <p>
                    At Windtech, I worked hands-on in wind tunnel testing, building and instrumenting scale models to
                    study
                    aerodynamic effects on city structures. Beyond the technical tasks, I often supported and
                    coordinated
                    new interns, ensuring work stayed on schedule and standards were met. This experience showed me that
                    leadership is not just about directing, but about helping others find their footing, sharing
                    knowledge,
                    and keeping the team aligned with deadlines.

                <h3>Atlantic & Peninsula (A&P)</h3>
                <p>
                    During my time at A&P, I was responsible for projects on naval vessels, including designing piping
                    additions and coordinating work during sea trials. These projects required not only technical skill,
                    but
                    also the ability to communicate with contractors, supervisors, and technicians across disciplines.
                    By
                    taking ownership of issues on HMAS <em>Choules</em> and ensuring progress despite obstacles, I
                    learned
                    how leadership in engineering means balancing problem-solving with clear, confident communication in
                    high-stakes environments.

                <h3>Advanced Navigation</h3>
                <p>
                    At Advanced Navigation, I contributed to new product introduction by designing jigs, repairing PCBs,
                    and
                    developing production processes. I quickly became a trusted point of contact when senior staff were
                    unavailable, coordinating technicians and ensuring production remained on track. This role taught me
                    that leadership is grounded in approachability and trust: by staying involved, communicating
                    clearly,
                    and supporting the team, I was able to step up and guide projects forward when it mattered most.
