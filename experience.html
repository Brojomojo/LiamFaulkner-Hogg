                <p>
                    At Windtech, I worked hands-on in wind tunnel testing, building and instrumenting scale models to
                    study aerodynamic effects on city structures. Beyond the technical tasks, I often supported and
                    coordinated new interns, ensuring work stayed on schedule and standards were met. This experience
                    taught me alot about 3D modelling and
                    leadership.

                <p>
                    During my time at A&P, I was responsible for projects on naval vessels, including designing piping
                    additions and coordinating work during sea trials. These projects required not only technical skill,
                    butm also the ability to communicate with contractors, supervisors, and technicians across
                    disciplines.
                    By taking ownership of issues on HMAS Choules and ensuring progress despite obstacles, I
                    learned alot about leadership and how to solve issues with clear, confident communication in
                    stressful environments.

                <h3>Advanced Navigation</h3>
                <p>
                    At Advanced Navigation, I’ve supported new product introductions by designing assembly jigs,
                    repairing electronics, and
                    developing reliable production processes. I’ve become a trusted point of contact when senior
                    engineers are
                    unavailable, coordinating technicians and keeping production moving during busy periods. Along the
                    way, I’ve gained
                    hands-on experience in mechanical design, embedded systems, and practical project management,
                    strengthening my ability
                    to take a product from early development through to production readiness.
